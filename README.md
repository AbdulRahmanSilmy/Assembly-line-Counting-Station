# Counting_Station-
This repo details a machine learning classification model that counts the number of workpieces in a manufacturing setting. You can read the [documentation] to get a more holistic over view of the process involved in developing and deploying the image classification model. 

You can view the [training notebook](https://github.com/AbdulRahmanSilmy/Assembly-line-Counting-Station/blob/main/baseline_model.ipynb) to see the steps taken in developing the model.

Note the work presented here is only the baseline model needed to count the number of workpieces. 

## Examples of the ML classification task
